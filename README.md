This serves as the manual to run the EmoWarn web application locally.

Step 1:
Install necessary packages. If the latest version of each package does not work, 
the corresponding version used in the original web application is shown below. 

Use format "pip install package-name" (replace package-name with the actual package 
name, e.g.: 
pip install scipy


Necessary packages to install:
1. scipy (version used: 1.15.3)
2. flask (version used: 3.0.3)
3. pickle (version used: 4.0)
4. tensorflow (version used: 2.18.1)
5. nltk (version used: 3.9.1)


Step 2: 
Run app.py, which is the web application using Flask as a wrapper API for the models. 
This can be done both through command line or IDE.

Usage manual for the web application:
The web app has a built in user manual which can be accessed by clicking the "Guide"
